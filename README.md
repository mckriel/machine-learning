# Machine learning
Various machine learning projects that I have worked on.

## 1. Bulldozer price prediction
* Predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics, with previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for.
* We are trying to predict a number, so therefore this is a **regression** problem.

## 2. Heart disease project
* Predict the probability of someone having heart disease based on certain attributes
* We are trying to predict a true or false outcome, so therefore this is a **classification** problem.

## 3. Mobile device price prediction
* Bob would like to predict the prices of mobile devices, based on their features, by using data from existing mobile device providers.
* We are trying to predict an price range from a given list of ranges, so therefore this is a **classification** problem.

## 4. Dog breed classifcation
* Build a model that tries to predict the breed of a dog (from a list of 120 breeds), from a photo, as accuratly as possible.
* We are trying to predict from a list of 120 dog breeds, so therefore this is a **classification** problem.
